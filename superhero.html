    My superhero is about a teen girl who after a brain surgey, become a child super genius. She couldn't fly and she didn't have super strength but she was able to combat ignorance in the world. She was able to by forcing her hand on people's foreheads and transferring information. Through doing this, she fixed problems and did her best to stomp out ignorance.
