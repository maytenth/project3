        Social: Our civilization has two main sections: the city-center and the neighborhood, with the river separating the two. The neighborhood is where all the housings are, along with a few primary schools and the farming area. The neighborhood is set up to where the social classes (excluding the king and the administration members) are mixed together. Our society does not push social order in the sense that everything is segregated and some classes have more privileges than others. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Political: The king of Umbawillrebu had restricted power due to the use of an educated administration which led to the most worthy people having the most political power, and therefore a stronger civilization. Our civilization was a constitutional monarchy; in which we had a king, but the power to make and pass legislation was held by his administration. However, the king had no say in electing his administration. The citizens of our civilization voted in whomever they thought had the most knowledge to better their society.
        <br>
        <br>
        Intellectual: Umbawillrebu focuses mainly on education and the king. Education is a high value because we wanted everyone in the civilization to have the chance to be able to participate in government roles, and we donâ€™t want ignorance to wash off and damage our society. Since education and knowledge was valued so much, schooling was free and granted to all to create equal opportunity to all citizens to learn and prosper.

        <br>
        Economical: In our civilization, the economy plays a very big role. Having a marketplace and lots of farmland, trading to benefit the economy is valued. The farms being at the bottom of the mountains, crops grew on rich soil and freshwater which helped the crops grow and prosper. Since the crops needed to be harvested, people worked on these farms to harvest but there was no forced labor or slavery involved. Once harvested, crops and food would be taken by merchants to the marketplace to trade with other citizens. Although the currency of the civilization is coin based, trading and bartering still occurred within the community between citizens.
